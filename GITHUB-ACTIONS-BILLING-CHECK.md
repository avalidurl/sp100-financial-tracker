# 🔍 GitHub Actions $6 Charge - Investigation & Fix

## 💰 What Happened Last Month?

You were charged $6. Let's figure out why and prevent it.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Check Your Billing Details

Go to: **https://github.com/settings/billing/summary**

Look for:
1. **"Actions minutes used"** - See what ran
2. **"Workflow runs"** - Click to see details
3. **Runner type** - Linux (free) vs macOS/Windows (paid)

---

## ⚠️ Common Causes of Charges (Even on Public Repos):

### 1. **macOS Runners** (MOST LIKELY CAUSE) 💰
```yaml
runs-on: macos-latest  # ❌ COSTS $0.08/minute!
```
- **Cost**: $0.08/minute ($80 per 1,000 minutes)
- **$6 charge** = ~75 minutes on macOS
- **Solution**: Use `ubuntu-latest` instead

### 2. **Windows Runners**
```yaml
runs-on: windows-latest  # ❌ COSTS $0.008/minute
```
- **Cost**: $0.008/minute ($8 per 1,000 minutes)
- **$6 charge** = ~750 minutes on Windows
- **Solution**: Use `ubuntu-latest` instead

### 3. **Private Repository**
- If your repo was private last month:
  - 2,000 minutes free
  - Then $0.008/minute
  - **$6** = using ~2,750 minutes total (750 paid)

### 4. **Other Workflows in Your Account**
- Check ALL your repositories
- You might have other projects with workflows running

### 5. **Storage Costs**
- Large artifacts stored
- Check: Settings → Billing → Storage

## ✅ Solutions to Prevent Future Charges

### Solution 1: Always Use Linux Runners (FREE)

```yaml
jobs:
  update-data:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # ✅ FREE FOREVER on public repos
```

**The workflows I just created use `ubuntu-latest`** ✅

### Solution 2: Verify Repository is Public

```bash
# Check your repo visibility
# Go to: https://github.com/avalidurl/sp100-financial-tracker/settings

# Should show: 🔓 Public
```

If private → Make it public or be aware of 2,000 min/month limit

### Solution 3: Set Spending Limits

```
GitHub Settings → Billing → Spending limits
Set limit to: $0 (prevent ANY charges)
```

This will:
- Stop workflows if you hit limits
- Prevent surprise charges
- You can adjust later if needed

### Solution 4: Review All Active Workflows

```bash
# Check what workflows exist
# Go to: https://github.com/avalidurl/sp100-financial-tracker/actions

# Look for:
- Any workflows using macOS/Windows
- Long-running workflows
- Workflows that run too frequently
```
